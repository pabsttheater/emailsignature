# Pabst Email Signature
As we grow as an organization, having consistent brand identity is important.
This carries through to how the public sees us through our emails.
Below are instructions on how to start using the “official” Pabst Theater Group signature.

A few notes:
- All social icons link to their respective pages
- Pabst Theater Group links to pabsttheater.org
- Listing your title is optional

## Install instructions
Your signature needs to be set up for every device or client that you're using; In other words, you'll need to set it up seperately for your desktop, webmail, and phone. To get started:
1. Open a new tab and open http://pabsttheater.github.io/pabst_email_signature/pabstsig.html
2. Select all of the visible signature; Make sure it's all highlighted and copy it (command+c):

2. Go back to your Gmail settings and scroll down about halfway to signature text area. Select the radio button enabling the textarea, then click in the text area and paste (command+v). In the event that it doesn't let you paste, click the "Remove Formatting" button and try again:
